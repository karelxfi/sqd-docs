# Accessing a Portal

When building data pipelines with Portal, you have two options for accessing Portal endpoints:

## Option 1: Self-Hosted Portal

Run your own Portal instance for complete control over your data access infrastructure.

**Best for:**
- Private or custom networks
- Teams with strict data sovereignty requirements
- Maximum control over infrastructure
- No external dependencies

**Key benefits:**
- Complete control over data access
- No rate limits (subject to your own infrastructure)
- Works with any EVM or Solana chain
- Open-source implementation you can audit and modify

## Option 2: Managed Portal

Use SQD-hosted Portal endpoints for instant access without infrastructure management.

**Best for:**
- Getting started quickly
- Production apps without infrastructure overhead
- Teams who want to focus on building rather than operations

**Key benefits:**
- Instant access—no infrastructure to manage
- Production-ready with high availability
- Free tier available for development
- Access to 200+ networks with zero setup

## Choosing the Right Option

Both options use the same Portal API interface, so your code remains the same regardless of which option you choose. The decision depends on your specific requirements:

- **Choose self-hosted** if you need complete control, have custom infrastructure requirements, or want to avoid external dependencies
- **Choose managed** if you want to get started quickly, prefer not to manage infrastructure, or need production-ready endpoints immediately

<Tip>
  You can start with managed endpoints for development and switch to self-hosted later if needed. The API interface is identical, so migration is straightforward.
