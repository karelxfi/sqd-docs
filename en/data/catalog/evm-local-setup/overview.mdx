# Local EVM Devnet Setup

Index your local devnet data and query it using the SQD Portal API. This setup allows you to run a complete indexing stack on your machine using Docker.

## What This Provides

A local deployment that:

- Ingests blockchain data from your RPC endpoint
- Stores blocks with full transaction details, receipts, traces, and state diffs
- Exposes the Portal API for querying your local chain data
- Works with any EVM-compatible devnet or testnet

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system
- Access to an **EVM RPC endpoint** (local devnet or testnet URL)
- **Sufficient disk space** - the setup stores the entire blockchain locally

<Note>
For production devnets with significant block history, allocate at least 50GB of disk space initially and monitor growth.
</Note>

## Architecture

The setup runs two Docker services:

### hotblocks-service

Connects to your RPC endpoint and fetches blockchain data including:
- Block headers and transactions
- Transaction receipts
- Execution traces
- State diffs

### hotblocks-db

Stores the blockchain data and provides:
- Portal API query interface on port 8000
- Efficient data retrieval and filtering
- Same API as the public SQD network

## Next Steps

Continue to the [Configuration](/en/data/catalog/evm-local-setup/configuration) page to set up your Docker services.
