<Info>
  Starting today (2025-02-23) all open private network gateways are rate limited
  at 50 requests per 10 seconds per IP. Higher bandwidths will soon become
  available via the public network.
</Info>

This section lists public gateways of the [open private network](en/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) that serve data of Solana and compatible networks. Gateway URLs should be used with the [`setGateway()`](en/solana-indexing/sdk/solana-batch/general/#set-gateway) `SolanaDataSource` configuration method, for example:

```typescript
const dataSource = new SolanaDataSource().setGateway(
  "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/solana-mainnet"
);
```

Read more about Solana indexing in the [dedicated section](en/solana-indexing).

See [Solana API](en/solana-indexing/network-api/solana-api) if you're looking to interface with one of these gateways directly.
