<Info>
  Starting today (2025-02-23) all open private network gateways are rate limited
  at 50 requests per 10 seconds per IP. Higher bandwidths will soon become
  available via the public network.
</Info>

SQD's [open private network](en/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) serves Tron data via the following gateway:

```
https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/tron-mainnet
```

Gateway URL should be used with the [`setGateway()`](en/tron-indexing/tron-batch-processor/general/#set-gateway) `TronBatchProcessor` configuration method:

```typescript
const processor = new TronBatchProcessor().setGateway(
  "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/tron-mainnet"
);
```

Read more about Tron indexing in the [dedicated section](en/tron-indexing).

See [Tron API](en/tron-indexing/network-api/tron-api) if you're looking to interface with the Tron gateway directly.
