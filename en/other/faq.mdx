## Network Overview

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's SQD Network?">

SQD Network is a huge and growing compute cluster consisting of 2500+ decentralized workers.

Each worker has 1 TB of storage and is equipped with a powerful query engine, allowing them to serve queries to the Network.

Decentralization means that the workers are not controlled by a single party but are supported by independent operators across the globe.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's Portal?">

Portal, formerly known as Gateway, is a service opening a window to the Network for the user.

It communicates with decentralized workers via _libp2p_, providing a simple and efficient HTTP API for streaming data.

You can think about it as a **bridge** connecting centralized and decentralized worlds.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's hotblocks?">

While static archival data is served from the Network allowing very high _throughput_, the "last-mile" real-time data requires low _latency_.

That's why this data is stored together with the portal and receives live updates from RPC nodes.

The portal then combines both data sources to provide a single stream of data that has both high throughput and low latency.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run my own Portal?">

Yes! But to access SQD Network, you have to lock SQD tokens. The more SQD is locked, the higher rate limit you get.

For most people it's easier to use one of the existing Portals with flexible payment options provided by its operators.

For example, we're providing a public Portal for free to test your code before going to production.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What data is available?">

Currently, SQD Network supports **raw blockchain data** for 200+ networks.

It means that you can request which fields you need, set filters, and get results from the entire blockchain history downloaded within **minutes or hours** (depending on the amount of extracted data) as opposed to days or months, as it would be with direct RPC requests.

The aggregation (calculating token balances, prices, etc) is then done on the client. We also provide a convenient SDK for that.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What exactly are we releasing at the end of 2025?">

We've already been running a centralized version of the Network called "v2 archives".

Switch to the Network gives multiple benefits:

- hundreds of times bigger compute cluster — Petabytes of storage, thousands of CPUs
- 10x faster Rust query engine
- much faster data streaming enabled by fetch-ahead parallelism
- "hotblocks" included — no need to bring your own RPCs anymore
- permissionless access
- much bigger datasets, like the full history of Solana and Eclipse

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is SQD Network?">

SQD Network is a decentralized data lake focused on making blockchain data accessible, regardless of scale. [Worker nodes](../network/worker) store the data and run queries on their local data chunks, while data access nodes (called _SQD Portals_) request partial query results from multiple workers, concatenate the outputs, and expose a stream-based API.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a decentralized data lake?">

A decentralized data lake is a distributed system that stores and organizes large amounts of raw data in its native format until it's needed. SQD Network is an example of a decentralized data lake, providing scalable and efficient access to blockchain data.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are some use cases for SQD's decentralized data lake?">

SQD's decentralized data lake powers various blockchain applications:

- Indexing blockchain data for quick access
- Blockchain explorers
- Analytics platforms
- Multi-chain aggregators
- Real-time and historical data APIs
- dApp backends and more

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is SQD production-ready? Can I trust it for my dApp?">

Yes! SQD is production-ready and reliable for your dApp. It has been effectively used in over 500 use cases across ecosystems, proving its trustworthiness and utility within the Web3 developer community.

<Check>
  SQD Network has powered production applications for hundreds of projects.

## Participation

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How can I participate in SQD Network?">

You can participate in SQD Network in several ways:

1. **Run a worker node** - [Set up a worker](../network/worker) to contribute storage and compute resources to the network and earn `SQD` tokens as rewards
2. **Delegate tokens** - [Delegate your `SQD` tokens](../network/delegate) to high-performing workers and earn a share of their rewards

<Tip>
  Non-technical users can still earn rewards by delegating tokens to reliable
  workers.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the hardware requirements to run a worker node?">

To run a single worker, you will need:

**Hardware:**

- 4 vCPU
- 16GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- Stable 24/7 Internet connection (at least 1Gbit)

**Network:**

- Public IP address
- Two ports open for incoming traffic:
  - One UDP port for P2P communication (default: 12345)
  - One TCP port for Prometheus metrics (default: 9090)

**Financial:**

- 100,000 `SQD` tokens (in your wallet or vesting contract)
- Some Arbitrum ETH for gas fees

<Info>
  A single account can register multiple workers. See the [worker setup
  guide](../network/worker) for detailed instructions.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't code. How can I participate in SQD Network?">

Non-technical participants can contribute in multiple ways:

**Delegation** - [Delegate SQD tokens](../network/delegate) to reliable workers and earn a percentage of their rewards.

**Community Growth** - Help grow the SQD Network by:

- Cultivating a vibrant community
- Amplifying the network's reach through social media
- Sharing information across various platforms

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does participating in SQD Network require committing my tokens?">

Yes. When you delegate SQD or register a worker, your tokens will be locked for a period of 100,000 Ethereum blocks (approximately 14 days), starting at the end of the current [epoch](#what-is-an-epoch-in-the-context-of-sqd-network).

<Warning>Your tokens cannot be withdrawn during the lockup period.</Warning>
