# Pipes SDK Overview

Pipes SDK is a highly customizable blockchain indexing library built by Subsquid that enables you to create efficient data pipelines for blockchain data. It provides a modular, composable architecture for fetching, transforming, and persisting blockchain data.

<Tip>
  Pipes SDK is designed for developers who need maximum flexibility and control
  over their indexing pipelines with minimal overhead.
</Tip>

## What is Pipes SDK?

Pipes SDK is a TypeScript library that lets you build blockchain data pipelines using a simple, composable pattern: **Source → Transformer → Target**.

- **Sources** fetch blockchain data from the SQD Network
- **Transformers** process and enrich the data
- **Targets** persist data to databases, files, or other destinations

This modular approach allows you to create self-contained, reusable components that can be combined in flexible ways.

## Key Features

### Lightweight and Fast

- Minimal dependencies and overhead
- High-performance data fetching from SQD Network
- Efficient batch processing

### Highly Composable

- Mix and match sources, transformers, and targets
- Create composite transformers that combine multiple data streams
- Build reusable, self-contained modules

### Developer-Friendly

- Works with npm, yarn, and Bun
- Full TypeScript support
- Simple, intuitive API

### Production-Ready

- Built-in cursor management for resuming indexing
- Fork handling for blockchain reorganizations
- Automatic progress tracking
- Integration with Clickhouse and other databases

## Architecture

Pipes SDK follows a pipeline architecture where data flows through three main components:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Source] --> B[Transformer]
    B --> C[Target]
    
    style A fill:#3B82F6,stroke:#1E40AF,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#8B5CF6,stroke:#6D28D9,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style C fill:#10B981,stroke:#059669,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

### Sources

Sources are responsible for fetching blockchain data from the SQD Network. They:

- Accept queries that specify what data to fetch (logs, transactions, traces, state diffs)
- Handle block ranges and data filtering
- Support cursor-based resumption
- Manage blockchain forks and reorganizations

### Transformers

Transformers process raw blockchain data and can:

- Decode smart contract events and function calls
- Add queries dynamically based on data requirements
- Transform and enrich data
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Be composed together for complex pipelines

### Targets

Targets receive processed data and:

- Write to databases (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL)
- Export to files (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- Log to console for debugging
- Track progress with cursors
- Handle blockchain forks

## When to Use Pipes SDK

Pipes SDK is ideal for:

- **Rapid prototyping** - Quick iteration on data pipeline designs
- **Custom data workflows** - Full control over data processing logic
- **Performance-critical applications** - Minimal overhead, maximum speed
- **Modular architectures** - Reusable, composable components
- **Non-standard outputs** - Custom targets beyond typical databases

Consider Squid SDK if you need:

- Auto-generated GraphQL APIs
- Full TypeORM integration with migrations
- Built-in schema management
- Complete production deployment templates

## Comparison with Squid SDK

| Aspect            | Pipes SDK        | Squid SDK                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Learning curve    | Gentle           | Moderate                  |
| Flexibility       | Maximum          | Structured                |
| GraphQL API       | Manual           | Auto-generated            |
| Database options  | Any (DIY)        | TypeORM, Files, BigQuery  |
| Schema management | Manual           | Auto-generated migrations |
| Best for          | Custom pipelines | Production APIs           |
