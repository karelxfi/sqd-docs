# DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) is a Python indexing framework that can use [SQD Network](subsquid-network/) as a data source. It offers:

- SQLite, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB data sinks
- GraphQL APIs based on Hasura

Development workflow uses the `dipdup` tool to generate a stub project. Once done with that, all you have to do is to define the data schema and the handlers. Take a look at their [quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart-evm) for more details.

With its handler-based architecture and the choice of Python as the transform logic language, DipDup is easier to develop for than [Squid SDK](sdk/), but has higher requirements on database IO bandwith and CPU. The IO bandwidth issue is partially solved by DipDup's caching layer used for database access.

## Getting Started

Visit the [DipDup documentation](https://dipdup.io/docs/) to get started with building Python-based indexers using SQD Network.
