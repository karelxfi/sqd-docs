# EVM Processor Architecture

The processor service is a Node.js process responsible for data ingestion, transformation and data persisting into the target database. By [convention](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/getting-started/layout), the processor entry point is at `src/main.ts`. It is run as:

```bash
node lib/main.js
```

For local runs, one normally additionally exports environment variables from `.env` using `dotenv`:

```bash
node -r dotenv/config lib/main.js
```

## EvmBatchProcessor

The Squid SDK provides the `EvmBatchProcessor` class for indexing EVM-compatible blockchains. By convention, the processor object is defined at `src/processor.ts`.

The `EvmBatchProcessor` is specifically designed for:

- Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks
- Processing logs, transactions, traces, and state diffs
- Efficient batch processing of blockchain data
- Real-time indexing with finality handling

See the [general settings reference](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/batch-processor) for detailed configuration options.

## Configuration

A processor instance should be configured to define the block range to be indexed, and the selectors of data to be fetched from [SQD Network](/en/network/overview) and/or a node RPC endpoint.

Key configuration methods:

- [`setGateway()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/batch-processor#set-gateway) - Configure SQD Network data source
- [`setRpcEndpoint()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/batch-processor#set-rpc-endpoint) - Configure RPC data source
- [`setFinalityConfirmation()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/batch-processor#set-finality-confirmation) - Set finality depth
- [`addLog()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/guides/indexing-logs) - Request event logs
- [`addTransaction()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/guides/indexing-transactions) - Request transactions
- [`addTrace()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/guides/indexing-traces) - Request execution traces
- [`addStateDiff()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/guides/indexing-state-diffs) - Request state changes
- [`setFields()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/field-selection) - Select data fields

## `processor.run()`

The actual data processing is done by the `run()` method called on a processor instance (typically at `src/main.ts`). The method has the following signature:

```typescript
run<Store>(
  db: Database<Store>,
  batchHandler: (
    context: DataHandlerContext<Store, F extends FieldSelection>
  ) => Promise<void>
): void
```

The `db` parameter defines the target [data sink](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/persisting-data/overview), and `batchHandler` is an `async` `void` function defining the data transformation and persistence logic. It repeatedly receives batches of SQD Network data stored in `context.blocks`, transforms them and persists the results to the target database using the `context.store` interface.

<Tip>
  To see the processor in action, check out the [EVM Processor in Action
  tutorial](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/tutorials/batch-processor-in-action).
</Tip>

## Batch context

Batch handler takes a single argument of `DataHandlerContext` type:

```typescript
export interface DataHandlerContext<Store, F extends FieldSelection> {
  _chain: Chain;
  log: Logger;
  store: Store;
  blocks: BlockData<F>[];
  isHead: boolean;
}
```

Here, `F` is the type of the argument of the [`setFields()`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/field-selection) processor configuration method. `Store` type is inferred from the `Database` instance passed into the `run()` method.

### `ctx._chain`

Internal handle for direct access to the underlying chain state via RPC calls. Rarely used directly, but rather by the facade access classes generated by the [typegen tools](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/typegen/generation).

### `ctx.log`

The native logger handle. See [Logger reference](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/logger).

### `ctx.store`

Interface for the target data sink. See [Persisting data](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/persisting-data/overview).

### `ctx.blocks`

On-chain data items are grouped into blocks, with each block containing a header and iterables for all supported data item types. Boundary blocks are always included into the `ctx.blocks` iterable with valid headers, even when they do not contain any requested data. It follows that batch context _always_ contains at least one block.

For EVM, each block provides the following iterables:

- `block.logs` - Event logs emitted by smart contracts
- `block.transactions` - Transactions included in the block
- `block.traces` - Execution traces of transactions
- `block.stateDiffs` - State changes caused by transactions

See the [context interfaces reference](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/context-interfaces) for detailed type information.

Depending on the data item type, items within the iterables can be canonically ordered by how the data is recorded on-chain (e.g. transactions are ordered but traces are not). The shape of item objects is determined by the processor configuration done via the `.setFields()` method.

An idiomatic use of the context API is to iterate first over blocks and then over each iterable of each block:

```typescript
processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async (ctx) => {
  for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let log of block.logs) {
      // filter and process logs
    }
    for (let txn of block.transactions) {
      // filter and process transactions
    }
    for (let stateDiff of block.stateDiffs) {
      // filter and process state diffs
    }
    for (let trace of block.traces) {
      // filter and process execution traces
    }
  }
});
```

<Note>
  The canonical ordering of `ctx.blocks` enables efficient in-memory data
  processing. For example, multiple updates of the same entity can be compressed
  into a single database transaction.
</Note>

<Warning>
  The processor cannot ensure that data not meeting its filters will be excluded
  from iterables. It only guarantees the inclusion of data that matches the
  filters. Therefore, it is necessary to filter the data in the batch handler
  prior to processing.
</Warning>

### `ctx.isHead`

Is `true` if the processor has reached the chain head. The last block in `ctx.blocks` is then the current chain tip.
