## Overview

Squid SDK provides powerful tools for indexing Solana blockchain data:

- **SolanaBatchProcessor**: High-performance batch processing of Solana data
- **Instruction decoding**: Decode program instructions with generated TypeScript code
- **Transaction indexing**: Index transactions, logs, and account state changes
- **Real-time sync**: Near real-time data ingestion with sub-second latency

## Next Steps

1. **Start with the quickstart** - Build a simple Solana indexer to understand the basics
2. **Explore tutorials** - Learn how to index specific Solana programs
3. **Reference documentation** - Deep dive into the Solana batch processor API
4. **Deploy to cloud** - Scale your indexer with SQD Cloud
