# SDK Overview

A _squid_ is an indexing project built with [Squid SDK](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-sdk) to retrieve and process blockchain data from the [SQD Network](/en/network/overview). The Squid SDK is a set of open-source TypeScript libraries that retrieve, decode, transform, and persist blockchain data.

<Info>
  All stages of the indexing pipeline—from data extraction to transformation to
  persistence—are performed on [batches of
  blocks](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/batch-processing) to maximize indexing
  speed.
</Info>

The modular architecture of the SDK makes it possible to extend indexing projects (squids) with custom plugins and data targets.

## Required squid components

### Processor

A _processor_ is the main component of your squid. The term refers to both:

1. The main Node.js process of the squid
2. The main object (`processor`) of this process, where `processor.run()` is the entry point

`processor` objects handle data retrieval and transformation; data persistence is handled by a separate object called [Store](#store).

#### For Substrate chains

Use [`SubstrateBatchProcessor`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/substrate/reference/general) via the [`@subsquid/substrate-processor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/substrate-processor) NPM package for Substrate-based networks like Polkadot and Kusama.

<Note>
  Unlike EVM chains, Substrate chains require an RPC endpoint for metadata retrieval, in addition to the SQD Network gateway.
</Note>

### Store

A _store_ is an object that processors use to persist their data. SQD offers three store classes:

#### TypeORM Store (PostgreSQL)

Use [`TypeormStore`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/persisting-data/typeorm) for saving data to PostgreSQL. Requires three packages:

- [`@subsquid/typeorm-store`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/typeorm-store)
- [`@subsquid/typeorm-codegen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/typeorm-codegen) (code generator, install with `--save-dev`)
- [`@subsquid/typeorm-migration`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/typeorm-migration)

#### File Store

Use [`file-store`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/persisting-data/file) via [`@subsquid/file-store`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/file-store) for saving data to filesystems. This is a modular system with a variety of [extensions](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/reference/store/file) for various formats and destinations.

#### BigQuery Store

Use [`bigquery-store`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/persisting-data/bigquery) via [`@subsquid/bigquery-store`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/bigquery-store) for saving data to [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).

<Tip>You can mix and match any store class with any processor class.</Tip>

## Optional squid components

### Typegen

A _typegen_ is a tool for generating utility code for technology-specific operations such as decoding.

#### For Substrate chains

Use [`squid-substrate-typegen`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/substrate/reference/typegen) via [`@subsquid/substrate-typegen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/substrate-typegen) to generate type-safe interfaces for:

- Substrate events
- Extrinsics (calls)
- Storage items
- Runtime constants

<Note>
  Install typegen packages with `--save-dev` as they are only needed during
  development.
</Note>

### Types Bundle

For Substrate chains with metadata version below 14, you may need a [types bundle](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/substrate/reference/types-bundle-miniguide) to properly decode historical data.

### GraphQL server

Squids that store their data in PostgreSQL can make it available as a GraphQL API via a variety of supported servers. See [Serving GraphQL](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/features/serving-graphql).

SQD provides its own server called [OpenReader](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/reference/openreader-server/overview) via the [`@subsquid/graphql-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@subsquid/graphql-server) package. The server runs as a separate process with these features:

- [Core API](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/reference/openreader-server/api/intro) automatically derived from the schema file
- Extensible with [custom queries](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/reference/openreader-server/configuration/custom-resolvers)
- [Basic access control](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/reference/openreader-server/configuration/authorization) support

### Squid CLI

[Squid CLI](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/cli) is a utility for managing your squid development workflow:

- Retrieve squid templates
- Manage chains of commands commonly used in development
- Run all squid processes at once
- Deploy to [SQD Cloud](/en/cloud/overview)
