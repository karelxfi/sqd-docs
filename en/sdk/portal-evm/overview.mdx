description: "Access raw EVM blockchain data through SQD Portal's decentralized network"
---

Portal provides direct access to raw EVM blockchain data through a decentralized network of 2000+ worker nodes. Query blocks, transactions, logs, traces, and state diffs with 10-50x faster performance than traditional RPC nodes.

## Quick Start

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST 'https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet/stream' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "evm",
    "fromBlock": 18000000,
    "toBlock": 18001000,
    "fields": {
      "block": { "number": true, "timestamp": true },
      "log": { "address": true, "topics": true, "data": true }
    }
  }'
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { DataSource } from "@subsquid/portal-client";

const dataSource = new DataSource({
  network: "ethereum-mainnet",
});

const blocks = await dataSource.getBlocks({
  from: 18000000,
  to: 18001000,
  fields: {
    block: { number: true, timestamp: true },
    log: { address: true, topics: true, data: true },
  },
});
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet/stream"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
payload = {
    "type": "evm",
    "fromBlock": 18000000,
    "toBlock": 18001000,
    "fields": {
        "block": {"number": True, "timestamp": True},
        "log": {"address": True, "topics": True, "data": True}
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
```

## Access Methods

Portal offers three ways to access blockchain data:

### Cloud Portal

Managed Portal access through SQD Cloud with no setup required.

- No token requirements or infrastructure setup
- Integrated with SQD Cloud deployment platform
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Ideal for production applications

**Endpoint:** Provided via SQD Cloud environment
