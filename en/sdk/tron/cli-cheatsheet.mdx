# CLI cheatsheet

This guide provides a quick reference to the commands needed to launch the squid and manage the database.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Compile the project

```bash
npx tsc
```

### Launch Postgres database to store the data

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Apply database migrations to create the target schema

```bash
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
```
### Run indexer

```bash
node -r dotenv/config lib/main.js
```

### Check out the indexed swaps

```bash
docker exec "$(basename "$(pwd)")-db-1" psql -U postgres \
  -c "SELECT id, logs_count, found_at FROM contract ORDER BY logs_count desc LIMIT 10"
```

You can use the `sqd` utility to shorten these commands and manage their interrelations. [Learn more here](squid-cli/commands-json).
