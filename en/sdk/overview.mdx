# SQD SDK

**TypeScript libraries that transform raw Portal data into actionable insights**

SQD SDK provides type-safe TypeScript libraries for building blockchain data pipelines. While Portal gives you raw blockchain data, the SDK adds data transformation, decoding, and persistence capabilities on top of it.

## How SDK Relates to Portal

```
Portal (Raw Data) → SDK (Transform & Process) → Your Database/System
```

- **Portal** provides the raw blockchain data through HTTP API
- **SDK** uses Portal as its data source and adds:
  - Event and transaction decoding
  - Type-safe data transformation
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Database persistence
  - Real-time data ingestion

<Info>
  SDK uses Portal under the hood. When you use SDK, you're still accessing
  blockchain data through Portal—the SDK just makes it easier to work with.
</Info>

## Key Benefits

- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types from ABIs
- **Automatic Decoding** - Decode logs, transactions, and state changes automatically
- **Flexible Persistence** - Write to PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, files, or custom targets
- **High Performance** - Optimized batch processing with backpressure handling
- **Developer Experience** - Hot reload, local development, comprehensive tooling

## Two SDK Options

SQD offers two SDKs to match your needs:

  <Card title="Pipes SDK" icon="pipe" href="/en/sdk/pipes-sdk/quickstart">
    **Streaming library for custom pipelines** - Lightweight and flexible -
    Stream data to any target - Full control over data flow - Perfect for ETL
    pipelines Best for: Custom data pipelines, analytics, non-PostgreSQL targets
  </Card>

  <Card title="Squid SDK" icon="squid" href="/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/quickstart">
    **Complete framework with GraphQL** - Full-featured indexer framework -
    Built-in PostgreSQL + GraphQL - Schema-driven development - Cloud deployment

## When to Use SDK vs Portal Directly

**Use SDK when you need:**

- Automatic ABI decoding
- Data transformation logic
- Database persistence
- Type-safe development
- Batch processing optimization

**Use Portal directly when:**

- Building in non-TypeScript languages
- Need maximum control over HTTP requests
- Simple data extraction without transformation
- Integrating with existing systems

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your SDK">
    Decide between Pipes SDK (streaming) or Squid SDK (framework) based on your
    needs
  </Step>

## Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pipes SDK">
    ```typescript
    import { EvmPortalClient } from '@subsquid/portal-evm'
    import { run } from '@subsquid/portal-pipes'
    
    // Connect to Portal
    const portal = new EvmPortalClient({
      url: 'https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/ethereum-mainnet'
    })
    
    // Stream and transform data
    run(portal, async function* (source) {
      for await (const batch of source) {
        // Transform and yield processed data
        yield processBlocks(batch)
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Squid SDK">
    ```typescript
    import { EvmBatchProcessor } from '@subsquid/evm-processor'
    
    // Configure processor (uses Portal internally)
    const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
      .setGateway('https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet')
      .setBlockRange({ from: 18_000_000 })
      .addLog({ address: ['0x...'], topic0: ['0x...'] })
    
    // Process batches
    processor.run(new TypeormDatabase(), async ctx => {
      // Decode and persist to PostgreSQL
      for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
        for (let log of block.logs) {
          // Access decoded data
        }
      }
    })
    ```
