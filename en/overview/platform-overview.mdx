Currently, SQD Network serves raw historical on-chain data from  using . In the future, it will additionally support general-purpose SQL queries and an ever-growing collection of structured data sets derived from on- and off- chain data."

## SQD Network[​](#sqd-network "Direct link to SQD Network")

[SQD Network](en/subsquid-network/) API currently provides:

- raw event logs
- transaction data (with receipts)
- execution traces (for selected networks)
- state diffs (for selected networks)

It supports all major [EVM](en/subsquid-network/reference/networks/#evm--ethereum-compatible) and [Substrate](en/subsquid-network/reference/networks/#substrate-based) networks, with more in the works. [Let us know](https://t.me/HydraDevs) if you'd like us to support some other network.

Currently there are two deployments of SQD Network:

1. Production-ready [private cluster](en/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) running on SQD infrastructure (formerly known as Subsquid Archives). Access to the cluster is free and public.
2. A [decentralized permissionless network](en/subsquid-network/overview/#permissionless-public-network), currently a testnet.

User-facing [API](en/subsquid-network/reference/) between these two is identical. Use it directly whenever you need historical blockchain data older than about 6-24 hours in either **(1)** high volume or **(2)** filtered form.

<Accordion title="Example use cases for the SQD Network direct API">
  * boost the performance of existing pipelines by replacing per-block RPC requests with batch-requests to SQD Network

- non-Typescript indexers, mobile SDKs

- high-performance data pipelines for raw historical data

- a high-performance data source for tools like ApeWorkX, Cryo

- ad-hoc queries over historical on-chain data, such as

      * "all transactions from a given address in a range of blocks"
      * "all events with a given topic in a range of blocks"

</Accordion>

For real-time use cases such as app-specific APIs use [Squid SDK](en/sdk/): it'll use SQD Network to sync quickly, then seamlessly switch to real-time data. If you already have a subgraph indexer, you also have an option to [run it against the network](en/subgraphs-support/).

## Squid SDK[​](#squid-sdk "Direct link to Squid SDK")

[Squid SDK](en/sdk/) is a powerful Typescript toolkit for building indexers on top of SQD Network, featuring

- [High-level libraries](en/sdk/reference/processors/) for extracting and filtering the SQD Network data in what can be though of as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines
- [Ergonomic tools](en/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/) for decoding and normalizing raw data and efficiently accessing [network state](en/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/state-queries/)
- Pluggable [data sinks](en/sdk/reference/store/) to save data into Postgres, files (local or s3) or BigQuery
- An expressive [GraphQL server](en/sdk/resources/serving-graphql/#openreader) with a schema-based [config](en/sdk/reference/schema-file/)
- Seamless handling of [unfinalized blocks and chain reorganizations](en/sdk/resources/unfinalized-blocks/) for real-time data ingestion
- rapid data extraction and decoding [for local analytics](en/sdk/tutorials/file-csv/)

The SDK is a go-to choice for production solutions and prototypes of

1. custom APIs based on data from sets of smart contracts, and
2. low-cost, highly performant in-house data pipelines

that can work in real time setting (\&lt;1s chain latency). Take a look at the list of [concrete, real-world applications](en/sdk/faq/#real-world-applications) for which Squid SDK was a good fit.

## SQD Cloud[​](#sqd-cloud "Direct link to SQD Cloud")

A Platform-as-a-Service for deploying Squid SDK indexers, featuring

- provisioning of [Postgres](en/cloud/reference/pg/) and other [compute resources](en/cloud/reference/manifest/) for indexers
- [zero downtime migrations](en/cloud/resources/slots-and-tags/#zero-downtime-updates) between indexer versions
- provisioning of [high-performance RPC endpoints](en/cloud/reference/rpc-proxy-networks/) for real-time applications
- intuitive deployment management through a [Web application](https://app.subsquid.io) or [CLI](en/squid-cli/)
- Google Cloud-level [SLA](en/cloud/pricing/#slas)
