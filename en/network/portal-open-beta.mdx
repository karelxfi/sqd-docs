Welcome to the SQD Portal Open Beta! This guide provides instructions on what you can do with Portal and what to expect from this release.

## What is SQD Portal?

SQD Portal is a decentralized, streaming-based data retrieval solution designed to replace centralized gateways. It provides faster, more reliable, and flexible access to blockchain data through a distributed network of worker nodes.

<Info>
  SQD Portal can supply both historical and real-time data seamlessly,
  eliminating the need for separate RPC endpoints in many cases.
</Info>

### Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized** - Powered by 1,900+ independent worker nodes
- **High Replication** - Redundant data storage for maximum reliability, capable of querying up to 20 million blocks per second
- **Improved Performance** - A new Rust-based query engine leverages parallelized queries and optimizations, delivering a **10-50x performance boost** compared to centralized gateways
- **Real-time Capability** - Stream real-time data including unfinalized blocks

<Note>
  Performance improvements are specific to data retrieval. If your application
  has other bottlenecks (like database limitations), you may see more moderate
  gains in overall indexing speed.
</Note>

**Real-time Data Availability:**

- Currently available: Solana
- Coming soon: EVM and Substrate networks

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Explore Soldexer for Solana" icon="rocket">

If you're working with Solana, visit [soldexer.dev](https://soldexer.dev) to explore our new client architecture powered by the Portal API.

<Check>
  Soldexer provides optimized tooling specifically for Solana developers.

</Step>

<Step title="Migrate to Cloud Portal" icon="cloud">

Cloud users can switch from centralized gateways to our dedicated Cloud Portal for enhanced performance and the latest query engine features.

**Migration Guides:**

- [EVM and Substrate users](/en/cloud/resources/migrate-to-portal-on-evm-or-substrate)
- [Solana users](/en/cloud/resources/migrate-to-portal-on-solana)

<Tip>
  Cloud Portal offers significantly better performance than centralized
  gateways.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Set Up a Self-Hosted Portal" icon="server">

Take complete control of your data infrastructure by running your own Portal.

**Requirements:**

- Minimum 10,000 SQD tokens
- Working Docker installation
- Some Arbitrum ETH for gas

**Setup Guide:** [Self-Hosting Instructions](/en/portal/self-hosting)

<Warning>
  You'll need to keep your SQD tokens locked while using your portal.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Explore the Public Portal" icon="globe">

The Public Portal provides access to nearly all datasets previously available from centralized gateways. Ideal for development and testing.

Browse EVM datasets at [portal-ui.sqd.dev](https://portal-ui.sqd.dev/).

<Info>
  Solana [(and compatible SVM
  networks)](subsquid-network/reference/networks/#solana-and-compatibles) and
  Substrate datasets coming soon.
