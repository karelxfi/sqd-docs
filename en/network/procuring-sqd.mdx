Select between fast bridges or native bridges based on your priorities:
- **Fast bridges:** Quick transfers (minutes to hours)
- **Native bridges:** Lower fees but longer wait times (up to 7 days)
</Step>

Use [IceCreamSwap bridge](https://icecreamswap.com/bridge?chain=base) for quick transfers.

<Check>
Your tokens will arrive within minutes to a few hours.

2. Then bridge from [Ethereum → Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=arbitrum-one&sourceChain=ethereum&token=0x1337420ded5adb9980cfc35f8f2b054ea86f8ab1)
