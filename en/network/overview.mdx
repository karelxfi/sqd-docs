SQD Network is a distributed query engine and data lake that powers the SQD ecosystem. It serves historical blockchain data for 2000+ networks, enabling you to access data at near-zero cost with granular filtering and efficient batch processing.

<Info>
  SQD Network provides superior data access compared to conventional chain node
  RPCs through its rich streaming and filtering capabilities, allowing you to
  query multiple blocks simultaneously.
</Info>

## Network Variants

SQD Network operates in two independent configurations:

1. **Decentralized permissionless network** - A fully decentralized network where anyone can participate
2. **Private network** - A permissioned network operated by Subsquid Labs GmbH, trusted by 400+ production indexers. See the [list of supported networks](/en/data/networks/overview)

Both variants are freely accessible and use the same API.

<Tip>

  [integration form](https://forms.gle/ioVNFiPjZgvUNunY9) or contact us in the
  [SquidDevs Telegram chat](https://t.me/HydraDevs).
</Tip>

## Permissionless Public Network

The decentralized version of SQD Network is now in mainnet. It serves data for almost [all networks](/en/data/networks/overview) supported by the [private cluster](#open-private-network), with the temporary exception of Solana.

The latest data access node—SQD Portal—fetches data chunks from multiple worker nodes in parallel and exposes a streaming API. It is currently in closed beta.

### How to Participate

You can participate in the public network in two ways:

- **[Run a worker node](/en/network/worker)** - Contribute storage and compute resources to the network and earn SQD tokens
- **[Delegate SQD tokens](/en/network/delegate)** - Reward high-performing workers and share in their profits

## Open Private Network

SQD's private data lake (formerly known as Archives) is a production-ready fork of early SQD Network running on SQD infrastructure. It provides reliable data access while the permissionless network matures.

<Info>
  The gateway of this private network is public and free to query. Access
  gateway URLs via [`sqd gateways list`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/tools/cli/gateways)
  or browse the [complete gateways list](/en/data/networks/overview).

### Using Gateways in Your Indexer

<Tab title="EVM">

List all supported EVM networks:

```bash
sqd gateways list -t evm
```

Configure your [squid's](/en/sdk/overview) [`EvmBatchProcessor`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/evm/reference/batch-processor):

```typescript processor.ts
const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor().setGateway(
  "https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet"
);
```

Browse [EVM gateways](/en/data/networks/evm).

<Tab title="Substrate">

List all supported Substrate networks:

```bash
sqd gateways list -t substrate
```

Configure your [squid's](/en/sdk/overview) [`SubstrateBatchProcessor`](/en/sdk/squid-sdk/substrate/reference/general):
