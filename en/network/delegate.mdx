<Info>
  By delegating, you commit your tokens for approximately 7 days (50,000
  Ethereum blocks) plus the time until the end of the current
  [epoch](subsquid-network/faq/#epoch) (20 minutes or less). Withdrawal is not
  possible during this period.
</Info>

The easiest way to participate in SQD Network is to delegate your `SQD` tokens to worker nodes. This guide shows you how to delegate and maximize your rewards.

## How to Delegate

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect to the SQD Network app" icon="link">

Go to [network.subsquid.io](https://network.subsquid.io) and connect your wallet.

<Check>
  You're connected when your wallet address appears in the interface.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose a worker" icon="magnifying-glass">

Navigate to the "Dashboard" tab to view all available workers.

Review worker performance metrics:

- **Uptime percentage** - Higher is better
- **Delegation capacity** - More capacity means more room for your delegation
- **APR** - Expected annual percentage return

<Tip>
  Look for workers with high uptime and available delegation capacity for
  optimal rewards.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Delegate your tokens" icon="coins">

1. Click the "Delegate" button next to your chosen worker
2. Enter the amount of `SQD` tokens you want to delegate
3. Click "Confirm" to proceed

<Check>The form will show you the expected lock period and rewards.</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Confirm the transaction" icon="check">

Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for it to complete on-chain.

<Check>
  Transaction confirmed! Your delegation is now active and earning rewards.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Monitor your delegation" icon="chart-line">

Go to the "Delegate" tab to view your active delegations.

<Note>

  [epoch](subsquid-network/faq/#epoch) ends.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Undelegating Your Tokens

<Steps>
<Step title="Wait for the lockup period" icon="clock">

Wait for your delegation lockup period to expire. The period is approximately **7 days** (50,000 Ethereum blocks), starting at the first block following the end of the [epoch](subsquid-network/faq/#epoch) when you delegated.

<Warning>
  You cannot undelegate your tokens until the lockup period has passed.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Access your delegations" icon="wallet">

1. Go to [network.subsquid.io](https://network.subsquid.io)
2. Navigate to the "Delegate" tab
3. You should see all your active delegations

<Info>
  An inactive "Undelegate" button indicates the delegation lockup period has not
  yet passed.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Initiate undelegation" icon="arrow-up-from-bracket">

1. Click the "Undelegate" button next to your delegation
2. Enter the `SQD` amount you want to withdraw
3. Click "Confirm" and approve the transaction in your wallet

<Check>
  Your tokens will be returned to your wallet once the transaction completes.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Maximizing Your Rewards

<Tip>
  Choose high-quality but less popular workers for optimal rewards. Look for
  workers with: - **High uptime percentage** (90%+) - **Available delegation
  capacity** - **Consistent performance history**
</Tip>

### Optimal Delegation Amount

Both workers and their delegators earn the most rewards when the total delegated `SQD` count is around **30,000 tokens**. Delegating significantly more or less than this optimal amount may result in lower rewards.

<Note>
  The optimal delegation amount may change based on network parameters. Monitor
  your delegation performance regularly.
