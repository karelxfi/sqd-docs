<Accordion title="What is SQD Network?">

SQD Network is a decentralized data lake focused on making blockchain data accessible, regardless of scale. [Worker nodes](subsquid-network/worker) store the data and run queries on their local data chunks, while data access nodes (called _SQD Portals_) request partial query results from multiple workers, concatenate the outputs, and expose a stream-based API.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I participate in SQD Network?">

You can participate in SQD Network in several ways:

1. **Run a worker node** - [Set up a worker](subsquid-network/worker) to contribute storage and compute resources to the network and earn `SQD` tokens as rewards
2. **Delegate tokens** - [Delegate your `SQD` tokens](subsquid-network/delegate) to high-performing workers and earn a share of their rewards

<Tip>
  Non-technical users can still earn rewards by delegating tokens to reliable
  workers.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a decentralized data lake?">

A decentralized data lake is a distributed system that stores and organizes large amounts of raw data in its native format until it's needed. SQD Network is an example of a decentralized data lake, providing scalable and efficient access to blockchain data.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are some use cases for SQD's decentralized data lake?">

SQD's decentralized data lake powers various blockchain applications:

- Indexing blockchain data for quick access
- Blockchain explorers
- Analytics platforms
- Multi-chain aggregators
- Real-time and historical data APIs
- dApp backends and more

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is SQD production-ready? Can I trust it for my dApp?">

Yes! SQD is production-ready and reliable for your dApp. It has been effectively used in over 500 use cases across ecosystems, proving its trustworthiness and utility within the Web3 developer community.

<Check>
  SQD Network has powered production applications for hundreds of projects.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the hardware requirements to run a worker node?">

To run a single worker, you will need:

**Hardware:**

- 4 vCPU
- 16GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- Stable 24/7 Internet connection (at least 1Gbit)

**Network:**

- Public IP address
- Two ports open for incoming traffic:
  - One UDP port for P2P communication (default: 12345)
  - One TCP port for Prometheus metrics (default: 9090)

**Financial:**

- 100,000 `SQD` tokens (in your wallet or vesting contract)
- Some Arbitrum ETH for gas fees

<Info>
  A single account can register multiple workers. See the [worker setup
  guide](subsquid-network/worker) for detailed instructions.
</Info>

<Accordion title="How do I deploy a simple squid indexer?">

You can start your first squid indexer in under 5 minutes using our templates! Learn more in the [development guide](sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/#templates).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What kind of datasets are available from SQD Network?">

SQD Network provides historical blockchain data optimized for batch access, enabling efficient indexing and querying across multiple blocks.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What chains are currently supported by SQD Network?">

SQD Network currently supports:

- EVM / Ethereum-compatible chains
- Substrate-based chains
- Solana
- Fuel
- Starknet

View the [complete list of supported networks](subsquid-network/reference/networks).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I add a new chain to be indexed by SQD Network?">

Submit a request via our [integration form](https://app.deform.cc/form/3f1021b2-6b70-4850-af09-a3b610f048a4), and we'll respond as soon as possible.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't code. How can I participate in SQD Network?">

Non-technical participants can contribute in multiple ways:

**Delegation** - [Delegate SQD tokens](subsquid-network/delegate) to reliable workers and earn a percentage of their rewards.

**Community Growth** - Help grow the SQD Network by:

- Cultivating a vibrant community
- Amplifying the network's reach through social media
- Sharing information across various platforms

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does participating in SQD Network require committing my tokens?">

Yes. When you delegate SQD or register a worker, your tokens will be locked for a period of 50,000 Ethereum blocks (approximately 7 days), starting at the end of the current [epoch](#what-is-an-epoch-in-the-context-of-sqd-network).

<Warning>Your tokens cannot be withdrawn during the lockup period.</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is SQD's roadmap?">

View the up-to-date roadmap at [sqd.dev/roadmap](https://www.sqd.dev/roadmap).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does SQD Network have an app?">

Yes! Access the SQD Network app at [network.subsquid.io](https://network.subsquid.io).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why did SQD choose Arbitrum for its contracts?">

We chose Arbitrum for its:

- Large, active community
- High-quality tooling for smart contract deployment
- Cost-effective transactions

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where is the data that SQD Network indexes stored?">

The data indexed by SQD Network is stored in persistent storage. During the bootstrap phase, Subsquid Labs uses an S3-compatible service with backups pinned to IPFS for data redundancy and availability.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between SQD Network and the Graph Network?">

Learn about the key differences and review a comprehensive feature comparison in our [SQD vs The Graph](sdk/subsquid-vs-thegraph) guide.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does SQD Network make blockchain data accessible for free?">

SQD Network offers data access through two models:

**Open Private Network** - Free for consumers, funded by fixed subscription fees from blockchain networks providing data.

**Permissionless Public Network** - Requires locking `SQD` tokens to reserve bandwidth (requests per second). However, SQD provides a free rate-limited portal accessible to everyone—you only need tokens if running your own portal.

**Indexer Hosting** - [SQD Cloud](cloud) includes free unlimited access to a dedicated SQD Portal. You only pay for computational resources (CPUs, SSD space, etc.). View our [competitive pricing](/en/cloud/pricing).

<Info>
  You can also self-host your indexers on any infrastructure. See our
  [self-hosting guide](sdk/resources/self-hosting) for details.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does SQD ensure the security and privacy of the data accessed through the network?">

SQD Network employs validators who:

- Listen to logs of executed queries
- Resubmit queries to validate responses
- Trigger an arbitration process to handle any discrepancies

This validation mechanism ensures data integrity across the network.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is an epoch in the context of SQD Network?">

An "epoch" is a unit of time that SQD Network uses for internal settlement. It is [defined on-chain](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4cf58097d790b193d22ed633bf8b15c9bc4f0da7#readContract#F3) and is currently set to 100 L1 (Ethereum) blocks, or approximately 20 minutes.

</Accordion>
