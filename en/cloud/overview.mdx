# SQD Cloud Overview

SQD Cloud provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling your blockchain indexers. This guide shows you how to deploy a production-ready indexer ("squid") to SQD Cloud.

<Info>
  Before deploying to SQD Cloud, ensure you have a working squid locally. See
  [Development flow](sdk/how-to-start/squid-development) and the [Indexing
  SDK](sdk) section for development guidance.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/) (for local development)
- **Squid CLI** - [Installation guide](squid-cli/installation)
- **Working squid** - A locally tested indexer ready for deployment

<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare the squid for deployment" icon="list-check">

Ensure your squid is ready for production deployment:

- **Test locally** - Verify the squid works as expected in your local environment
- **Performance check** - Ensure no major performance issues. See [Best practices](cloud/resources/best-practices) for guidance
- **Update configuration** - Update the `squid.yaml` file with correct values for your use case
- **Set up secrets** - Configure SQD Cloud secrets if your squid requires sensitive data

<Warning>
  Production deployments should be thoroughly tested locally to avoid issues in
  the cloud environment.
</Warning>

<Check>Your squid is tested and ready for cloud deployment.</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Register a SQD account" icon="user-plus">

Create your SQD Cloud account:

1. Visit the [SQD Cloud console](https://app.subsquid.io)
2. Click **Create an account** and fill in the required information
3. Or sign in with your GitHub or Google account

<Check>You'll receive a confirmation email to verify your account.</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a professional organization" icon="building">

Set up your organization for production use:

1. Create a new [organization](cloud/resources/organizations) in SQD Cloud
2. Upgrade to [professional](cloud/resources/organizations/#professional-organizations) by attaching a valid credit card in the "Billing" tab

<Note>
  You can skip this step, but you'll only be able to deploy to your account's
  [playground](cloud/resources/organizations/#playgrounds). Playground squids
  are trial/development solutions with limited functionality and are not
  suitable for production use.
</Note>

<Check>
  Your professional organization is ready for production deployments.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Edit the squid.yaml file" icon="file-code">

Configure your deployment manifest for SQD Cloud:

### Basic Configuration

First, set squid name, description, and other metadata in the [header section](cloud/reference/manifest/#header) of the `squid.yaml` file.

If necessary, configure your [`build` options](cloud/reference/manifest/#build) next. If the defaults (NodeJS v20 and `npm` for package manager) work for you, just create an empty `build` section.

Finally, edit the [`deploy` section](cloud/reference/manifest/#deploy) to specify the deployment options.

**Example configuration:**

```yaml squid.yaml
manifest_version: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid

build:

deploy:
  processor:
    cmd: ["sqd", "process:prod"]
  api:
    cmd: ["sqd", "serve:prod"]
```

<Note>
  The `processor` and `api` commands are
  [commands.json](squid-cli/commands-json)-based. This is optional but
  recommended for complex deployments.
</Note>

### Configure Addons

SQD Cloud addons enable extra services for your squid. Enable them in the `deploy.addons` section based on your requirements.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="RPC Addon" icon="network-wired">

Use the [`rpc` addon](cloud/resources/rpc-proxy) for real-time data access:

**Steps to configure:**

1. Open the **RPC endpoints** tab in the SQD Cloud sidebar
2. Copy the URL of your chosen endpoint
3. Add it to your `.env` file:

```bash .env
RPC_ARBITRUM_ONE_HTTP=<endpoint-url>
```

4. Enable the addon in your `squid.yaml`:

```yaml squid.yaml
deploy:
  addons:
    rpc:
      - arbitrum-one.http
```

5. Configure your processor to use the RPC endpoint:

```typescript src/main.ts
import { assertNotNull } from "@subsquid/util-internal";

export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor().setRpcEndpoint(
  assertNotNull(
    process.env.RPC_ARBITRUM_ONE_HTTP,
    "Required env variable RPC_ARBITRUM_ONE_HTTP is missing"
  )
);
// ...the rest of the processor configuration
```

<Info>
  The RPC addon provides reliable access to blockchain nodes for real-time data
  queries and state access.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PostgreSQL Addon" icon="database">

For squids that [write their data to PostgreSQL](sdk/resources/persisting-data/typeorm), use the [`postgres` addon](cloud/reference/pg):

**Basic configuration:**

```yaml squid.yaml
deploy:
  addons:
    postgres:
```

**Production scaling:**

<Warning>
  Always configure the [`scale` section for the
  addon](cloud/reference/pg/#scaling) when deploying to production.
</Warning>

```yaml squid.yaml
scale:
  addons:
    postgres:
      storage: 100G
      profile: medium
```

<Check>
  PostgreSQL addon automatically provides database connection credentials
  through environment variables.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hasura Addon" icon="server">

If your squid [uses a dedicated Hasura instance](sdk/resources/serving-graphql/#hasura), configure the [`hasura` addon](cloud/reference/hasura) to provision it.

```yaml squid.yaml
deploy:
  addons:
    hasura:
```

<Tip>
  Use Hasura when you need advanced GraphQL features like subscriptions,
  permissions, or complex query capabilities beyond the default OpenReader.
</Tip>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scale Settings

Configure resource allocation for your squid components to ensure optimal performance.

#### API Service Configuration

Squids include a GraphQL service by default. You can enable or disable it by adding or removing the `deploy.api` section. Use the [`scale.api` section](cloud/reference/scale/#api) to configure resources and replicas.

```yaml squid.yaml
deploy:
  api:
    cmd: ["sqd", "serve:prod"]
scale:
  api:
    profile: large
    # load-balance across three replicas
    replicas: 3
```

<Note>
  This configuration works with
  [OpenReader](sdk/resources/serving-graphql/#openreader) (default) and
  [PostGraphile](sdk/resources/serving-graphql/#postgraphile). For
  [Hasura](sdk/resources/serving-graphql/#hasura), see the [`hasura` addon
  documentation](cloud/reference/hasura).
</Note>

#### Processor Configuration

Configure the indexer processor resources based on your data processing requirements. See the [processor scale reference](cloud/reference/scale/#processor) for all available options.

```yaml squid.yaml
scale:
  processor:
    profile: medium
```

<Tip>
  Choose a processor profile based on your indexing workload. Start with `small`
  for testing and scale up to `medium` or `large` for production workloads.
</Tip>

#### Dedicated Deployment

[Dedicated deployment](cloud/reference/scale/#dedicated) ensures your squid runs on dedicated resources for optimal performance and reliability. This is the default for professional organizations.

<Warning>
  If your `squid.yaml` contains `dedicated: false` (from previous playground
  deployments), you must remove it or set it to `true` for production use.
  **Collocated squids are not recommended for production environments.**
</Warning>

To explicitly enable dedicated deployment:

```yaml squid.yaml
scale:
  dedicated: true
```

<Check>
  Dedicated deployment is enabled by default for all professional organization
  deployments.
</Check>

### Complete Configuration Example

Here's a complete `squid.yaml` file with all deployment options configured:

```yaml squid.yaml
manifest_version: subsquid.io/v0.1
name: sample-squid

build:

deploy:
  addons:
    postgres:
    rpc:
      - arbitrum-one.http
  processor:
    cmd: ["sqd", "process:prod"]
  api:
    cmd: ["sqd", "serve:prod"]

scale:
  addons:
    postgres:
      storage: 100G
      profile: medium
  processor:
    profile: medium
  api:
    profile: large
    # load-balance across three replicas
    replicas: 3
  dedicated: true
```

<Check>
  Your `squid.yaml` is now configured for production deployment on SQD Cloud.
</Check>

<Tip>
  For detailed information on all available deployment options, see the
  [deployment manifest reference](cloud/reference/manifest).
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Set any required secrets" icon="key">

If your squid uses any sensitive data such as a private URL or an access key, store it securely in a [SQD Cloud secret](cloud/resources/env-variables/#secrets).

You can add secrets using either method:

- **Via SQD Cloud Console**: Navigate to the `Secrets` tab in the sidebar and add your values
- **Via CLI**: Use the [`sqd secrets`](squid-cli/secrets) command

<Warning>
  Never commit secrets or API keys directly to your code repository. Always use
  SQD Cloud secrets for sensitive data.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy the squid" icon="rocket">

Deploy your squid to SQD Cloud using the Squid CLI:

1. Open the **Squids** tab in the SQD Cloud sidebar
2. Click the **Deploy a squid** button
3. Follow the prompts to install the Squid CLI if needed
4. Set up your authentication key as shown in the console
5. Ensure your squid name matches the one in `squid.yaml`

Run the deployment command from your project root:

```bash
sqd deploy .
```

<Info>
  The deployment process will build your squid, upload it to SQD Cloud, and
  start the processor and API services according to your `squid.yaml`
  configuration.
</Info>

<Check>
  Once deployed, your squid will appear in the Squids list with status
  information.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Monitor the squid" icon="chart-mixed">

After deployment, monitor your squid's performance and health through the SQD Cloud dashboard:

**What you can monitor:**

- **Logs**: View real-time logs from your processor and API services
- **Metrics**: Track memory usage, CPU usage, and processing speed
- **Status**: Check the health status of your squid components
- **Sync progress**: Monitor blockchain indexing progress

**To access monitoring:**

1. Navigate to the **Squids** tab in the SQD Cloud sidebar
2. Select your deployed squid from the list
3. View the monitoring dashboard with metrics and logs

<Tip>
  Visit the [logging documentation](cloud/resources/logging) for tips on
  emitting structured logs and using log filters effectively.
</Tip>

<Check>
  Your squid is now running and processing blockchain data on SQD Cloud.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Use the squid" icon="plug">

Your deployed squid is now accessible and ready to use:

**Access your data:**

- **Database access**: If your squid uses PostgreSQL, access credentials are available in the **DB access** tab of your squid's card
- **GraphQL API**: Access your squid's GraphQL endpoint from the deployment details
- **Direct queries**: Connect to your database using the provided credentials

**Production workflows:**

Squid deployments use [slots and tags](cloud/resources/slots-and-tags) for flexible deployment management. This enables:

- **Zero downtime updates**: Deploy new versions without interrupting service
- **Version management**: Maintain multiple versions simultaneously
- **Traffic routing**: Control which deployment serves production traffic

<Tip>
  We strongly recommend using the [zero downtime update
  workflow](cloud/resources/slots-and-tags/#zero-downtime-updates) for all
  production squids.
