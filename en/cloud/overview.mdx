# SQD Cloud

**Enterprise-grade deployment platform for blockchain data indexers**

SQD Cloud is a managed infrastructure platform that handles the complexity of deploying, scaling, and monitoring your blockchain indexers. Focus on building your data pipelines while we handle the DevOps.

## Key Benefits

- **Zero DevOps Required** - Deploy with a single command, no infrastructure management
- **Built-in Monitoring** - Real-time logs, metrics, and health status for all components
- **Automatic Scaling** - Configure resources and replicas to match your workload
- **Production-Ready** - Dedicated deployment, managed databases, and high availability
- **Cost-Effective** - Pay only for resources you use with transparent pricing

## When to Use SQD Cloud

SQD Cloud is ideal for:

- **Production deployments** requiring reliability and uptime
- **Teams** that want to focus on building, not operations
- **Projects** that need monitoring and observability built-in
- **Applications** requiring managed PostgreSQL, RPC access, or GraphQL APIs

<Info>
  Before deploying to SQD Cloud, ensure you have a working indexer locally. See
  [Development flow](sdk/how-to-start/squid-development) and the [Indexing
  SDK](sdk) section for development guidance.
