# Pricing Details & Examples

SQD Cloud pricing is straightforward: you pay only for the compute and storage resources your squids consume. The SQD Network provides data at no charge, making your costs predictable and transparent.

<Note>
  **Good news:** Data egress is completely free. No charges for outbound traffic
  or API responses.
</Note>

## Pay-as-you-go Pricing

Your total monthly cost is the sum of:

- **Compute costs**: Hourly rates for API, processor, and database services
- **Storage costs**: Monthly rate per GB of database storage
- **RPC costs**: Only if you exceed the 2M free monthly requests

<Tab title="API & Processor">

### API and Processor Compute

Both API and processor services use the same pricing structure. They are configured and billed independently.

| Profile     | Price per Hour | Monthly Cost (24/7) | Best For                                                           |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **small**   | `$0.04`        | `~$29`              | Development, low-traffic APIs, simple data processing              |
| **medium**  | `$0.08`        | `~$58`              | Production APIs with moderate traffic, standard indexing workloads |
| **large**   | `$0.15`        | `~$108`             | High-traffic APIs, complex data transformations                    |
| **xlarge**  | `$0.30`        | `~$216`             | Very high traffic, intensive processing requirements               |
| **2xlarge** | `$0.60`        | `~$432`             | Enterprise-scale applications, maximum performance needs           |

<Info>
  **API Replicas:** If you run multiple API replicas, each replica is billed
  separately. For example, 2 replicas of medium API = `2 × $0.08 = $0.16/hr`.

### Database Compute

Dedicated Postgres database instances with guaranteed resources.

| Profile     | Price per Hour | Monthly Cost (24/7) | vCPU | RAM  | Best For                                   |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **small**   | `$0.08`        | `~$58`              | 1    | 2GB  | Small datasets, development                |
| **medium**  | `$0.16`        | `~$115`             | 2    | 4GB  | Medium datasets, moderate query load       |
| **large**   | `$0.33`        | `~$238`             | 4    | 8GB  | Large datasets, high query throughput      |
| **xlarge**  | `$0.66`        | `~$475`             | 8    | 16GB | Very large datasets, complex queries       |
| **2xlarge** | `$1.32`        | `~$950`             | 16   | 32GB | Enterprise-scale data, maximum performance |

<Note>
  Database costs include both compute (above) and storage (billed separately at
  `$0.50/GB/month`). See the [database scaling
  reference](/en/cloud/reference/pg/#scaling) for detailed specifications.
</Note>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Storage & Other">

### Database Storage

Storage is billed monthly based on actual usage.

**Price:** `$0.50 per GB per month`

Applies to both dedicated and collocated squids.

<Tip>
  Monitor your storage usage in the Cloud dashboard. Optimize your schema and
  data retention policies to control costs.
</Tip>

### Collocated Squids (Development)

Collocated squids bundle API, processor, and database into a single shared-resource deployment.

**Compute:** `$0.02/hr` (`~$15/month`)  
**Storage:** `$0.50/GB/month` (same as dedicated)

<Warning>
  Collocated squids share compute resources and performance is **not
  guaranteed**. They're perfect for development and testing but **not
  recommended for production** use.
</Warning>

### RPC Requests

Professional organizations include 2 million RPC requests per month at no additional cost.

**Overage pricing:** `$2.00 per million requests`

See [RPC addon documentation](/en/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy) for configuration details.

### Hibernated Squids

Hibernated squids are paused and only incur storage costs. No compute charges apply.

**Cost:** Storage only (`$0.50/GB/month`)

<Info>
  Hibernation is perfect for squids you want to keep available but don't need
  running continuously.
</Info>

### Multi-Processor Squids

Each processor in a multi-processor squid is billed independently based on its configured profile.

**Example:** 2 small processors + 1 medium processor = `2 × $0.04 + $0.08 = $0.16/hr`

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Our SLA applies to [dedicated](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#dedicated) squids deployed to [Professional organizations](/en/cloud/resources/organizations/#professional-organizations).

We align with the [SLAs of the Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla) and provide bill reductions based on uptime:

| Uptime Percentage | Bill Reduction |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| 95.00% - < 99.50% | 10%            |
| 90.00% - < 95.00% | 25%            |
| < 90.00%          | 100%           |

<Warning>
  The SLA covers SQD Cloud infrastructure (API availability, compute
  provisioning) but **does not** cover issues caused by client code, bugs in
  your squid, or upstream problems with SQD Network/RPC providers. You're
  responsible for provisioning adequate compute resources for your expected
  traffic.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Enterprise customers can negotiate custom SLA terms. [Contact
  us](https://calendly.com/d/yzj-48g-bf7/subsquid-demo) to discuss your
  requirements.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Cost optimization tips:** - Start with smaller profiles and scale up based
  on actual usage - Use collocated squids for development and testing - Consider
  hibernating squids that don't need to run 24/7 - Monitor storage usage and
  implement data retention policies - Use the [cost
  calculator](/en/cloud/pricing/overview#estimate-your-costs) to model different
  scenarios
