# Pricing Details & Examples

## Pay-as-you-go prices

The pricing is based solely on the resources consumed by the squid, as the SQD Network data is provided free of charge.
The total squid price is the sum of compute and database storage prices.

Data egress is not billed.

### Storage

Database storage is billed at `0.5$/mo` per Gigabyte, both for dedicated and collocated squids.

### Compute for dedicated squids

Dedicated squids have separate [compute profiles](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#services) for the Postgres database and API/processor services:

#### API/Processor

- `small`: `0.04$/hr`
- `medium`: `0.08$/hr`
- `large`: `0.15$/hr`
- `xlarge`: `0.30$/hr`
- `2xlarge`: `0.60$/hr`

API and processor are configured and billed separately. Also, if you use API replicas your cost is multiplied by the number of replicas. For example, running a small processor plus two replicas of medium API costs `0.04+2*0.08=0.20$/hr`.

Full profile descriptions are available [here](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#api) for the API and [here](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#processor) for the processor.

#### Database

- `small`: `0.08$/hr`
- `medium`: `0.16$/hr`
- `large`: `0.33$/hr`
- `xlarge`: `0.66$/hr`
- `2xlarge`: `1.32$/hr`

Profiles are described [here](/en/cloud/reference/pg/#scaling). Combine with the [cost of storage](/en/cloud/pricing/pricing-details/#storage) to get the full price of maintaining the database.

### Hibernated squids

For hibernated squids only the [storage costs](/en/cloud/pricing/pricing-details/#storage) are charged.

### Multi-processor squids

For multi-processor squids each processor is charged separately according to the compute profile.

### Collocated (development) squids

Collocated squids share compute resources and thus their performance is NOT guaranteed. We do not recommend using
collocated squids in production, but it's a good fit for development and testing.
Compute is billed at a flat rate of `$0.02/hr` (`~$15/mo`) per each collocated squid (API + processor + DB).
It is not possible to additionally configure a collocated squid except for the storage.

### RPC requests

The premium plan already includes a package of 2M requests per month. Above that, it is `$2/1M` requests.

## SLAs

Our SLA only applies to [dedicated](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#dedicated) squids deployed to [Professional organizations](/en/cloud/resources/organizations/#professional-organizations).

We align with the [SLAs of the Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla) and will reduce the bill based on the following schedule:

| Uptime            | Rebate |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| 95.00% - < 99.50% | 10%    |
| 90.00% - < 95.00% | 25%    |
| < 90.00%          | 100%   |

Note that the SLA applies only to the provisioning of the SQD Cloud services (API availability, provisioning of compute resources) and DOES NOT apply to client code. In particular, if a squid is stuck due to a bug or an upstream SQD Network/RPC issue, the SLA discounts don't apply. Similarly, the client is responsible for provisioning compute profiles adequate to the expected traffic.

For Enterprise plan customers, individual SLA terms may be negotiated.
