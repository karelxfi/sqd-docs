# SQD Cloud Pricing

SQD Cloud uses a transparent pay-as-you-go pricing model. You only pay for the compute and storage resources your squids consume. Data from the SQD Network is provided free of charge, with no hidden fees or data egress costs.

<Tip>
  Use our interactive cost calculator below to estimate your monthly costs based on your specific requirements.

## Free Tier

<Info>
Each account includes a free playground [organization](/en/cloud/resources/organizations) where you can deploy a single squid at no cost. This is perfect for testing, learning, and small projects. See [playground organization](/en/cloud/resources/organizations/#playgrounds) for limitations and details.

## Professional Organizations

## Billing Details

Billing is based on actual resource consumption and occurs monthly, typically on the first day of each month. You're only charged for the hours your squids are running and the storage they use.

<Note>
All compute resources are billed hourly. If you deploy a squid mid-month, you'll only pay for the actual hours it runs, not the full month.
</Note>
