## Free squids

Each account gets a playground [organization](/en/cloud/resources/organizations) where a single free squid can be deployed. Certain limitations apply; check the [playground organization](/en/cloud/resources/organizations/#playgrounds) section for details.

## Billing

SQD bills [organizations](/en/cloud/resources/organizations) for the resources used by their squids. To deploy production-ready squids and [configure](/en/cloud/reference/scale) their resources, the organization must have a [Professional status](/en/cloud/resources/organizations/#professional-organizations). All such organizations receive the following perks:

- unmetered GraphQL API requests
- deploying any number of pay-as-you-go [dedicated](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#dedicated) squids
- deploying any number of pay-as-you-go [collocated](/en/cloud/reference/scale/#dedicated) squids
- free 2M [RPC addon](/en/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy) requests monthly + just `$2/1M` afterwards
- priority support

Other resources used by squids are priced as described below. Billing typically occurs on the first day of each month.

We do provide enterprise discounts. If your use case requires a lot of resources or an individual SLA, [book a demo](https://calendly.com/d/yzj-48g-bf7/subsquid-demo) to get a personal quote.
