# Pricing FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is the difference between collocated and dedicated squids? Why are collocated squids much cheaper?">

Collocated squids share compute resources which means that it may be unresponsive if the neighbour squid is under high load.
While we do our best to ensure that the resources are shared fairly, we strongly recommend dedicated services for production use.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I deployed my squid yesterday, will it be billed for the whole month?">

No, only the actual hours the squid has been running will be billed.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I configure the profiles for my squid?">

Use the [manifest-based deployments](/en/cloud/reference/manifest/) and [the profile reference](/en/cloud/reference/scale/).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I use the provided RPC package? How do I set the rate limits for it?">

Please look at the [RPC addon docs](/en/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy/).
