# Pricing FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How does billing work? When am I charged?">

SQD Cloud uses hourly billing for compute resources and monthly billing for storage. You're only charged for the actual time your squids are running.

**Billing cycle:** Charges are calculated and billed on the first day of each month for the previous month's usage.

**Prorated charges:** If you deploy a squid mid-month, you only pay for the hours it actually runs. For example, a squid running for 360 hours (half a month) costs exactly half of the monthly rate.

<Note>
You can monitor your current usage and estimated costs in the SQD Cloud dashboard at any time.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between collocated and dedicated squids?">

**Collocated squids** share compute resources with other squids on the same infrastructure. This makes them much cheaper (`$0.02/hr` vs separate service costs) but means performance is not guaranteed. If a neighboring squid experiences high load, your squid may become slow or unresponsive.

**Dedicated squids** have guaranteed compute resources that are never shared. Each service (API, processor, database) runs on its own allocated resources with predictable performance.

<Warning>
We strongly recommend dedicated squids for production use. Collocated squids are perfect for development, testing, and staging environments.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I estimate my costs before deploying?">

Use our [interactive cost calculator](/en/cloud/pricing/overview#estimate-your-costs) to estimate costs based on your configuration. You can also review [real-world examples](/en/cloud/pricing/pricing-details#real-world-cost-examples) for common deployment scenarios.

<Tip>
Start with smaller profiles and monitor your actual resource usage. You can easily scale up if needed. It's better to start small and grow than to overprovision from the start.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my squid's compute profiles after deployment?">

Yes! You can modify your squid's compute profiles at any time using [manifest-based deployments](/en/cloud/reference/manifest/).

Simply update your manifest file with the new profiles and redeploy. The new pricing takes effect immediately. See the [profile reference](/en/cloud/reference/scale/) for all available options and their specifications.

<Info>
Profile changes require a brief redeployment. Plan accordingly for production squids to minimize downtime.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is database storage billed? Can I reduce storage costs?">

Database storage is billed at `$0.50 per GB per month` based on actual usage. This applies to both dedicated and collocated squids.

**Cost optimization strategies:**
- Implement data retention policies to remove old data you no longer need
- Optimize your database schema to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types (e.g., integers instead of strings where possible)
- Archive historical data to external storage (S3, BigQuery) if you don't need it for queries
- Monitor your storage usage in the Cloud dashboard

<Tip>
For data-heavy applications, consider a processor-only squid that exports to external storage instead of maintaining a large database.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the 2M free RPC requests? How do I use them?">

Professional organizations include 2 million RPC requests per month at no additional cost through the [RPC addon](/en/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy). This allows your squids to make blockchain RPC calls without managing your own RPC infrastructure.

**Overage pricing:** If you exceed 2M requests, additional requests cost `$2.00 per million`.

**How to use:** Configure the RPC proxy in your squid to route requests through SQD's infrastructure. See the [RPC addon documentation](/en/cloud/resources/rpc-proxy/) for setup instructions and rate limiting configuration.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I hibernate a squid?">

When you hibernate a squid, all compute services (API, processor, database) are paused. You only pay for storage costs (`$0.50/GB/month`) while the squid is hibernated.

**Benefits:**
- Preserve your squid's data and configuration
- Eliminate compute costs when not needed
- Resume quickly when you need the squid again

**Perfect for:**
- Seasonal applications that aren't needed year-round
- Development squids used only during working hours
- Backup squids kept ready but not actively running

<Info>
Hibernation and resumption are instant operations. You can hibernate and wake squids as often as needed.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I decide between collocated and dedicated for my use case?">

Choose based on your performance requirements and budget:

**Use collocated when:**
- Developing or testing new features
- Running staging environments
- Building proof-of-concepts or MVPs
- Budget is the primary concern
- Occasional slowness is acceptable

**Use dedicated when:**
- Running production applications
- Serving end users who expect consistent performance
- Processing time-sensitive data
- You need guaranteed response times
- Reliability is critical to your application

<Check>
Most teams use collocated for development and dedicated for production. This gives you cost-effective testing while ensuring production reliability.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any hidden fees or charges I should know about?">

No hidden fees! SQD Cloud pricing is transparent and predictable.

**What you pay for:**
- Compute (hourly rates for API, processor, database)
- Storage (monthly rate per GB)
- RPC requests (only above 2M/month)

**What's free:**
- Data egress (outbound traffic)
- GraphQL API requests (unlimited)
- SQD Network data access
- Deployments and redeployments
- Monitoring and logs

<Note>
The only variable costs are compute time and storage. Everything else is included with no additional charges.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you offer discounts for high-volume usage or long-term commitments?">

Yes! We offer enterprise plans with volume discounts, custom SLAs, and dedicated infrastructure for high-volume use cases.

**Enterprise benefits may include:**
- Volume-based pricing discounts
- Custom SLA terms
- Dedicated support channels
- Architecture consultation
- Priority feature requests
