# Portal Image Creation Needed

## File: `/images/PORTAL.png`

This image needs to be created to match the style of the existing product images.

### Style Reference

Look at the existing product images for style guidance:

- `/images/SDK.png` - Blue/navy gradient with white "SDK" text
- `/images/CLOUD.png` - Blue gradient with white "CLOUD" text
- `/images/NETWORK.png` - Gray gradient with white "NETWORK" text

### Required Image

Create `/images/PORTAL.png` with:

- Similar gradient background (suggest a unique color like teal/cyan or purple)
- Large white bold text saying "PORTAL"
- Same dimensions and style as existing product images
- Professional, clean look matching the brand

### Used In

- Home page main product cards (`/en/home.mdx`)
- Portal overview page (`/en/portal/overview.mdx`)

### Placeholder

Until this image is created, the Portal card on the home page will show a broken image link.
